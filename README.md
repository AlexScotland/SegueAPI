# Master FullStack Application
## Developed and Maintained by [AlexScotland](https://github.com/AlexScotland/)

# Synopsis
Master FullStack Application (MFSA) is a template used by myself to launch fullstack, scalable django applications.

The purpose of this is solely for setting a standard to follow for when I develop a new fullstack application.  I found that Django does not have a good standard set inplace, so I decided to make my own.

This repository was heavily inspired by [Django CookieCutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter-django), Utilizing most technologies, but slightly less weight.

# Features

- [ ] Simple, easy to read standard for creating new views withjin Django
- [ ] Object Oriented folder structure to allow for easily importable packages within applications
